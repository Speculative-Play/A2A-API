# Aunties + Algorithms: API

`v0.1`

A speculative web design project imagining a new vision of matrimonial websites in a South-Asian context. This is the backend for that application.

The initial project was developed in Ruby. But this was re-written in Python because I'm not cool enough to learn Ruby :(

Documentation can be found in the [Documentation folder](./Documentation) which also contains the [changelogs](./Documentation/Changelogs/)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and be sure you have python and django installed (see versions in [Tech Stack](#tech-stack)) below.
2. Run the dev server with `python3 manage.py runserver` (run this line in the root of the project)
3. 

### Tech Stack
